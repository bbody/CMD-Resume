# Contribution Guide
## Creating an issue
There are no specific rules for submitting issues, however if you can follow the [following guidelines](https://upthemes.com/blog/2014/02/writing-useful-github-issues/) it would make prioritizing and development easier.

## Development
### Setup
This guide assumes you are using a command line, if you want to use other tools please refer to your own tools documentation.

1. Clone the Github repository `git clone https://github.com/bbody/CMD-Resume.git`
2. Change directory to the repository `cd CMD-Resume`
3. Add git hooks to your project `git config core.hooksPath hooks` (if git version >= 2.9). Or *nix: `./setup-hooks.sh`, Windows: `setup-hooks.bat`
4. [Install Node and NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node) (if not already installed)
5. Install the dependencies `npm install`
6. Install gulp command line tool `npm i -g gulp-cli` or `sudo npm i -g gulp-cli` if the first does not work
7. Test if the running script works `gulp`

### Making changes
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch
3. Create an issue or ask to be assigned to an issue
4. Run command `gulp`
4. Make changes and write tests
5. Ensure tests and source code checking passes
6. Commit code (Using format of '[:emoticon:](https://github.com/slashsBin/styleguide-git-commit-message) Description of change') by default :pencil: is prepended to any commit message without an emoticon (through [git hook](https://github.com/bbody/CMD-Resume/blob/master/hooks/prepend-commit-emoticon.sh). **Optional:** [Change previous commit message](https://help.github.com/articles/changing-a-commit-message/)
7. Create pull request into main branch
