# Contribution Guide
## Creating an issue
There are no specific rules for submitting issues, however if you can follow the
[following guidelines][guide] it would make prioritizing and development easier.

## Development
### Setup
This guide assumes you are using a command line, if you want to use other tools
 please refer to your own tools documentation.

1. Clone the Github repository `git clone https://github.com/bbody/CMD-Resume.git`
2. Change directory to the repository `cd CMD-Resume`
3. [Install Node and NPM][install] (if not already installed)
4. Install the dependencies `npm install` and `npm run setup_local`
5. Install gulp command line tool `npm i -g gulp-cli` or
`sudo npm i -g gulp-cli` if the first does not work
6. Test if the running script works `gulp`

### Making changes
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch
3. Create an issue or ask to be assigned to an issue
4. Run command `gulp`
5. Make changes and write tests
6. Ensure tests and source code checking passes
7. Commit code (Using format of '[:emoji:][emo] Description of change') by
   default :pencil: is prepended to any commit message without an emoji.
   **Optional:** [Change previous commit message][commit]
8. Create pull request into main branch
